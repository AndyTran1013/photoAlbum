#React/NodeJS Photo Album

A project that I was working on using NodeJS as a backend to read images and thumbnails from a directory and display it using React

## How it Works
1. The server will read the thumbnail files from images/thumbnails and pass on the file names in a JSON string as a HTTP Request
2. React is used to display the thumbnails in a grid
3. When a thumbnail is clicked, the full image will be displayed in a modal window

##To Do...
1. Add a Nav bar to separate pictures by category (which will be divided up by subfolders in the backend)
